# BMW Coding
**BMW coding** is online service and similar to the coding function of ISTA+ (coding by vehicle order modification) and requires a fast and stable internet connection.  
It's only available for F series vehicles or higher.  
Because the database is too large for the app, this is a web application that only could be accessed from [Deep OBD](Deep_OBD_for_BMW_and_VAG.md).  
Vehicle telegrams are transferred via the integrated browser over the internet.  
After selecting the vehicle order modification a TAL is generated that could be executed in the next step.  
While TAL execution make sure, that the ignition is switched on, the motor is stopped and a charger with at least 60A is connected to the vehicle.  
Don't close or minimize the app page, because this will interrupt vehicle communication!  
In the [beta testing phase](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/de.holeschak.bmw_deep_obd) it will be free, later a license will be required to pay the server costs.
